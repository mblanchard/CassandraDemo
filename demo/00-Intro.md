### What is Cassandra?
 - Cassandra (C\*) is a distributed NoSQL/non-relational database
 - Queries are performed using CQL (the Cassandra Query Language)
   - CQL is a bit like SQL without joins or aggregations
   - C\*/CQL also imposes restrictions on sorting/filtering on read
 - Cassandra was developed internally at Facebook in 2008, became Apache project in 2010
